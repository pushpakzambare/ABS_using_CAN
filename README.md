‭The‬ ‭Automatic‬ ‭Braking‬ ‭system,‬ ‭if ‬‭implemented‬‭ can‬‭ avert‬‭ lots of ‬‭accidents ‬‭and‬ can‬ ‭save‬ ‭invaluable‬ ‭human‬ ‭lives‬ ‭and‬ ‭property.‬ ‭Implementation‬ ‭of‬ ‭such‬ ‭an‬ advanced‬ ‭system‬ ‭can‬ ‭be‬ ‭made‬ ‭compulsory‬ ‭similar‬ ‭to‬ ‭wearing‬ of seat belts so that accidents ‭‭can‬ ‭be‬ ‭averted‬ ‭to‬ ‭some‬ ‭extent.Our‬ ‭Automatic‬ ‭braking‬ ‭system ‭provides‬ ‭a‬ ‭glimpse‬ ‭into‬ ‭the‬ ‭future‬ ‭of‬ ‭automotive‬ ‭safety,‬ ‭and‬ ‭how‬ ‭much‬ ‭more‬ ‭advanced ‬‭these‬‭ individual ‬‭systems ‬‭can ‬‭be ‬‭for ‬‭avoiding‬‭ accidents‬‭ and ‬‭protecting ‭vehicle‬ ‭occupants‬ ‭when‬ ‭they‬ ‭are‬ ‭integrated‬ ‭into‬ ‭one‬ ‭system.‬ ‭The‬ ‭future‬ ‭of automotive safety is more than just developing new technology; it is shifting the spporach to safety. Automatic Breaking System approach represents a significant shift from the traditional approach to safety, but it is  fundamental to acheiving the substantial benefits.
